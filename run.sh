Let's create a new space for this tutorial." \

prompt \
    "We must build our frontend and backend first before we can deploy them.

The backend is a Java Spring Boot web application called $(bold "message-service"). It exposes two endpoints:

    GET  $(underline "/api/messages") : returns list of messages
    POST $(underline "/api/messages") : creates a new message

If it does not have a database attached it will run with an in-memory database.
We will build it into a .jar file. The .jar file will be located in $(underline "./message-service/target").

The frontend is a Javascript React application called $(bold "chat-app"). It continuously polls the $(bold "message-service") for messages and allows to create new ones. It expects the $(bold "message-service") at URL under $(underline "/api"). We will build it into a bundle of static files. The bundle will be located in $(underline "./chat-app/build").

Like any Javascript application, the $(bold "chat-app") is just a collection of static files that we want to serve. Hence, we will use the \"staticfile_buildpack\" for running it.

We point the the cli at $(underline "./chat-app/build") and let Cloud Foundry pick a random available route for us." \

However, the more users there are the more load will our $(bold "message-service") have. At this moment we only have one instance of it running. We need more!

Adding more instances is called horizontal scaling. This does not require a restart and is almost instantaneous.

Let's scale out to 3. Planet scale!" \

"This is weird. As we're using the application and sending messages, they change all the time.

Why is that? As we haven't provided it with a database, the $(bold "message-service") is running with an in-memory database. That means each instance has its own state. And every time we post or get messages we hit another instance. Hence, the inconsistency.

This setup is violating the idea of 'stateless processes' according to the twelve-factor app ($(underline "https://12factor.net/processes")).

Since Cloud Foundry might relocate instances in the cloud as it sees fit we might lose messages at any moment.
